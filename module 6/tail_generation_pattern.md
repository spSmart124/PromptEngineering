# Tail Generation Pattern

# Prompt
Whenever I ask you to write a prompt for me to accomplish a task, list what the task is, list alternative approaches for completing the task, and then write a prompt for yourself for each approach. When you are done, ask me for the next prompt to create alternatives for.

Ask me what I want you to write a prompt for.

## ChatGPT Response
Certainly! What task would you like me to write a prompt for?

## Prompt

## ChatGPT Response
Task: Write a prompt for ChatGPT to automatically detect questions in a chain of emails and summarize everyone's opinion on the questions as bullet points beneath each question.

Alternative Approaches:
1. Approach 1: Write a prompt that instructs ChatGPT to first identify all questions in the email chain, then extract responses related to each question, and finally summarize the opinions as bullet points.
2. Approach 2: Write a prompt that asks ChatGPT to simulate a conversation where it plays the role of a summarizer, asking the user to provide the email chain, and then generating the summary with bullet points.
3. Approach 3: Write a prompt that presents the email chain as a case study and asks ChatGPT to provide a summary report that includes the questions and corresponding opinions in bullet points.
Prompt for Approach 1:

ChatGPT, your task is to analyze the following chain of emails and identify
[Insert email chain here]

Prompt for Approach 2:
ChatGPT, let's simulate a conversation where you play the role of a summarize
User: Here is the email chain that needs to be summarized. [Insert email chain here]
ChatGPT: [Generates summary]

Prompt for Approach 3:

ChatGPT, consider the following chain of emails as a case study. Your task 1
[Insert email chain here]
Please let me know if you have another task for which you'd like me to write a prompt and create alternative approaches.


## Structure of Tail Generation Pattern

### Contextual Statement
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

* At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X. 

You will need to replace "Y" with what the model should repeat, such as "repeat my list of options", and X with what it should ask for, "for the next action". These statements usually need to be at the end of the prompt or next to last.

### Examples:

Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next.   
Ask me for what to outline.

From now on, at the end of your output, add the disclaimer "This output was generated by a large language model and may contain errors or inaccurate statements. All statements should be fact checked." Ask me for the first thing to write about.
