3.5.3. Experimenting with Tone and Style Variations
When crafting prompts for language models like ChatGPT, experimenting with variations in tone and style can be a valuable exercise. Tone refers to the attitude or emotional quality of the language, such as formal, casual, authoritative, or friendly. Style, on the other hand, encompasses the overall manner of expression, including academic, conversational, or instructional language. By testing different combinations of tone and style, users can gain insights into how these factors influence the model's responses and, ultimately, achieve the desired result.

The process of experimenting with tone and style variations begins with creating multiple versions of the same prompt, each with a distinct tone and style. For example, a user might craft one version of a prompt using a formal and academic tone, another using a casual and conversational tone, and a third using an authoritative and instructional tone. By comparing the model's responses to each version, the user can observe how the tone and style impact the content, language, and structure of the output. This iterative process of testing and analysis allows users to fine-tune their prompts, ensuring that the model's responses align with their specific goals and use cases. Whether the goal is to generate customer support responses, creative writing pieces, or technical documentation, experimenting with tone and style variations can help users optimize their interactions with ChatGPT.

What would you like me to do next? Please provide me with the specific bullet point you would like me to write content for, along with the number of paragraphs you would like me to write. Alternatively, you can provide just the bullet point if you would like me to expand on it and create a new outline.

## Structure of Menu Actions Pattern

### Contextual Statement
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

* Whenever I type: X, you will do Y.
* (Optional, provide additional menu items) Whenever I type Z, you will do Q. 
* At the end, you will ask me for the next action.

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate pattern, such as "estimate <TASK DURATION>" or "add FOOD". You will then need to specify an action for the menu item to trigger, such as "add FOOD to my shopping list and update my estimated grocery bill".

### Examples:

Whenever I type: "add FOOD", you will add FOOD to my grocery list and update my estimated grocery bill. Whenever I type "remove FOOD", you will remove FOOD from my grocery list and update my estimated grocery bill. Whenever I type "save" you will list alternatives to my added FOOD to save money. At the end, you will ask me for the next action.  
Ask me for the first action.
