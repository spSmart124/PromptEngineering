## Prompt
We are going to add a feature. I will tell you my start and end destination and you will provide a complete list of stops for me, including places to stop between my start and destination.

## ChatGPT Response
Sure! To provide you with a complete list of stops, including places to stop between your start and end destinations, I'll need to know the specific route you plan to take. Additionally, it would be helpful to know your preferences for types of stops (e.g., historical sites, natural attractions, restaurants, etc.), as well as any time constraints or other considerations you may have.
Once I have this information, I can suggest a list of potential stops along your route. These stops may include cities and towns, points of interest, landmarks, parks, and other attractions that you may find interesting based on your preferences.

To demonstrate how this feature would work, let's use an example route: "Nashville, TN to Atlanta, GA." I'll provide a sample list of stops along this route, including places to visit in both Nashville and Atlanta, as well as interesting stops along the way:

1. Start: Nashville, TN
Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum
Ryman Auditorium
The Parthenon in Centennial Park
2. Chattanooga, TN (en route stop)
Tennessee Aquarium
Lookout Mountain (includes Rock City, Ruby Falls, and the Incline Railway)
3. End: Atlanta, GA
Georgia Aquarium
World of Coca-Cola
Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park
Please note that the above list is just a sample and may not include all possible stops along the route. Additionally, the specific stops and attractions you choose to visit may depend on your interests, the amount of time you have available, and other factors.
If you have a specific route in mind, please provide the start and end destinations, as well as any additional information or preferences you have, and I'll be happy to provide a customized list of stops for your trip.
