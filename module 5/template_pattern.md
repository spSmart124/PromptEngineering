In the years before the American Civil War of 1861-1865, the Methodist Episcopal Church South had been considering the creation of a regional university for the training of ministers in a location central to its congregations. [18] Following lobbying by Nashville bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire, church leaders voted to found "The Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South" in Nashville in 1872. [18][19] However, lack of funds and the ravaged. state of the Reconstruction Era South delayed the opening of the college. [18]

The following year, McTyeire stayed at the New York City residence of Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose second wife was Frank Armstrong Crawford Vanderbilt (1839-1885), a cousin of McTyeire's wife, Amelia Townsend McTyeire (1827-1891); both women were from Mobile, Alabama.[20][21] [22] Cornelius Vanderbilt, the wealthiest man in the United States at the time, had been planning to establish a university on Staten island, New York, in honor of his mother. [18] However, McTyeire convinced him to donate $500,000 to endow Central University in order to "contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country [18]23)
