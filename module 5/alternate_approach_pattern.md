# Alternate Approach Pattern

## Prompt
From now on, if there are alternative ways to accomplish the same thing, list the best alternate approaches. Compare and contrast the alternatives and ask me which one I want to use.

## ChatGPT Response
Understood! I will provide alternative approaches when possible, compare and contrast them, and ask you to choose the one you'd like to use. To get started, please let me know what specific tank or question you have in mind, and I'll do my beat to provide you with multiple approaches and help you make an informed decision.

## Prompt
Write a prompt for ChatGPT using fow shot examples to determine if a date in YYYY-MM-DD format is a leap year. The output should either be "YYYY is a leap year" or "this is not a leap year".

## ChatGPT Response
To create a prompt for ChatGPT to determine if a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD is a leap year, we can use few shot learning by providing a few examples of input-output pairs. Here are two alternative approaches to writing the prompt:

Approach 1: Direct Question Format
In this approach, we directly ask ChatGPT whether a given date is in a leap year. We provide
a few examples of input-output pairs in a question-answer format.

yaml
Q: Is the year 2000 a leap year?
A: 2000 is a leap year.

Q: Is the year 1900 a leap year?
A: 1900 is not a leap year.

Q: Is the year 2020 a Leap year?
A: 2020 is a leap year.

Q: Is the year 2021 a leap vear?
A: 2021 is not a leap year.

Q: Is the year [INPUT_YEAR] a leap year?
A: [OUTPUT]

Approach 2: Conversational Format
In this approach, we use a more conversational format to ask ChatGPT whether a given date is in a leap year. We provide a few examples of input-output pairs in a conversational format.

vbnet
User: Tell me if 2000 is a leap year.
Assistant: 204 is a leap year.
User: What about 1900? Is it a leap year?
Assistant: 1900 is not a leap year.
User: How about the year 2020?
Assistant: 2020 is a leap year.
User: And 2021?
Assistant: 2021 is not a leap year.
User: Tell me if [INPUT YEAR] is a leap year.
Assistant: [OUTPUT]

Comparison:
* Approach 1 is more formal and structured, making it easier to understand and parse. It may be more suitable for applications where a clear and concise answer is required.
* Approach 2 is more conversational and natural, making it more engaging for users. It may be more suitable for applications where user interaction is important.

Please let me know which approach you would like to use, or if you have any other preferences or requirements.

## Structure of Alternative Approach Pattern

### Contextual Statement
To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

1. If there are alternative ways to accomplish a task X that I give you, list the best alternate approaches 
1. (Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach 
1. (Optional) include the original way that I asked 
1. (Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like to use

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate task.

### Examples:

For every prompt I give you, If there are alternative ways to word a prompt that I give you, list the best alternate wordings . Compare/contrast the pros and cons of each wording. 

For anything that I ask you to write, determine the underlying problem that I am trying to solve and how I am trying to solve it. List at least one alternative approach to solve the problem and compare / contrast the approach with the original approach implied by my request to you.
